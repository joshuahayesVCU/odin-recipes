This is the first project in the Odin Project Foundations course.

Current working on my skills in:

- Git
- HTML boilerplate
- HTML Links and Images
- Using neovim

Post Project recap:

- Easy project, didn't take much time to complete but did help me understand
  the syntax behind a barebones site. The hardest part of the project was remembering
  to commit often so my config history was a documentation of my code.
