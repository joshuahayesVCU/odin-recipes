      Yummy breakfast burritos are great to make ahead of time and toss into the
      air fryer in the morning when your looking for a filling breakfast and
      only have time for something quick. But with the price of eggs?

        allowing to melt and coat the surface eavenly.

        the way through.
      </li>

        While the sausage is cooking, slice the avacado, whisk eggs in a bowl
        with seasoning, and air fry tatter tots.
      </li>

        runny when taking them off heat. Otherwise, they will go dry in the air
        fryer.
