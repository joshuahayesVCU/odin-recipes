      Poorly cooked chicken is dry, tasteless, and hard to eat. The recipe below
      outlines the steps to create a juicy and well seasoned chicken that pairs
      well with veggies and rice to make a full weekday dinner meal.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Seasonings of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Butterfly your chicken by sclicing it evenly through the middle of the
        breast "hamburger style" to thin the breast and allow for faster cooking
      </li>
      <li>
        Season generously with salt, pepper, and seasonings of choice. Lay a
        sheet of tin foil across the entire breast and beat with a meat
        tenderizer to further flatten and even the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a pan to medium heat. When pan is hot, add a 2tb drizzle of olive
        oil into the pan and allow it to heat up before adding the chicken. Cook
        about 4-5 minutes on each side. Avoid flipping multiple times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a tablespoon of butter to the pan and allow it to melt. Flip the
        chicken in the butter to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the chicken to cool after removing from pan and before cutting
        into it to allow the juices to settle. Serve warm
      </li>
