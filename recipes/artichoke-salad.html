    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
      <li>1 fresh lemon</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>

      <li>
        Rinse the quinoa well in a fire wire mesh sieve. Place the rinsed quinoa
        in a pot with 1.75 cups water. Place a lid on the pot, turn the heat on
        to high, and allow the water to come to a boil Once it reaches a full
        boil, turn the heat on to high, and allow the water to come to a boil.
        Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer
        for 15 minutes

        While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the lemon garlic dressing. Zest the
        lemon, then squeeze the juice (you'll need 1/4 to 1/3 cup juice). Add
        the lemon juice and 1 tsp of the zest to a bowl or jar along with the
        olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper (10-15
        cranks of a pepper mill). Whisk the ingredients together or close the
        jar and shake until they are combined. Set the dressing aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the quinoa has cooked, spread it out into a casserole dish or
        other wide shallow dish and refrigerate uncovered for about 15 minutes
        to cool it down.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the quinoa is cooling, prepare the rest of the salad ingredients.
        Drain the artichoke hearts and roughly chop them into smaller pieces.
        Finely dice the red bell pepper. Roughly chop the parsley. Rinse and
        drain the chickpeas. Place the artichoke hearts, bell pepper, parsley,
        and chickpeas in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the quinoa has cooled, add it to the bowl with the other salad
        ingredients. Toss gently to combine, then drizzle the lemon garlic
        dressing over top. Gently toss again until everything is coated in
        dressing. Serve immediately or refrigerate up to 4-5 days.
